# Basic user overview

If you are just getting started with ontologies, this is the place for you. We have collected some very basic documentation here to set you on the path of using linked data.

Currently there are two pages:

- [What is an ontology?](basic-whatisontology.md)
- [How do I browse an ontology?](basic-viewing.md)
