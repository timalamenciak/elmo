# ELMO Ontology Documentation

Welcome to the ELMO documentation! ELMO is an application ontology for the Ecolink Model - a schema for knowledge graphs that describe environmental processes. This documentation is divided into three main levels depending on your level of use. Here we use a bicycle as a metaphor for an ontology:
