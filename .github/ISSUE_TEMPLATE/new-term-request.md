**Are you sure this is a new term and not one that can be imported?**
Double-check please! Search [OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4), [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/), etc.

**Proposed definition**
Please provide a proposed definition in an Aristotelian form (e.g. A is a B that Cs). Please include a reference for this definition (Wikipedia is acceptable).

*Exact* - an exact match
